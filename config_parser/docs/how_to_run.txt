To compile Skit code:

From pltcatan/config-parser
    ./skit -c file.skit

To run Skit code:
From pltcatan/config-parser
    ./skit file.skit

If you'd prefer to use skit like a traditional binary,
make sure to add it to your PATH environment variable.

If you're using a bash shell:
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/skit

Otherwise, consult your shell's documentation.
